## Website idea:

For the years I had learn to code, I had always chosen Venice as my subject to do it on. This is why I chose Venice again for this project


##  Website Design

-   With the creation of my website, as I had put a "content viewer" in my front page, making multiple divs called different things was not optimal. This is why most of my divs for this website contains a prefix such as "BoardA" (The homepage's image). This makes editing and finding the divs easier.
    
-   The colours that I used were from themes such as "Clean" and "Minimalist", this why why most of the pages background were silver-white to black. However to make certain titles stand out, I would select a colour pallete that would suit the theme of the topic. Such as Blue for transportation headings as water was the main way for travelling in Venice.
    
-   The main font for this website is "Aramanth" and for headings and others important texts, I used "Kaushan". This makes the website more appealing as the user is able to distinguish the difference between a header and a big body text.
    
-   I had made the website viewable for most resolutions. This was done by centering most of my content in the middle with margins at the sides. This makes the content more digestable than having a huge image or text flooding the person's eyes.
    
-   This website is also mobile friendly with the use of "@media" tags. The set widths that I used was 1400px, 1000px. This is because most phones these days have a resolution of 1440x2560px. This is why most of my website uses viewport measurements and %s as it makes changes better.
    
-   The footer of the website consists of links to certain websites with a contact us button. This button will trigger a animation popping out a form. This form is directed to the action page related to the website.
